# Contributions to SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA Database Documentation

Found a mistake in our documentation? Always wanted to add a step in one of our procedures that could save many others much time? Then you're at the right place! All contributions made to the Markdown files in the [docs](docs) directory are reviewed, and if deemed valuable are added to our [official documentation on SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/docs/HANA_CLOUD_DATABASE). The easiest way is to start there, and choose _Edit_ to find the right Markdown file to contribute to.

You can currently make contributions to the following guides in this repository:
* SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA Database Developer Guide for Cloud Foundry Multitarget Applications (SAP Business App Studio)
* SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA Database Developer Guide for Cloud Foundry Multitarget Applications (SAP Web IDE Full-Stack)
